pdfmerge

Simple utility script I created for a free online converter 
API @ www.convertapi.com to merge multiple files into one pdf, 
a feature that is basically only available with paid PDF software, 
and even Convert API only offers 1500 one-time use seconds of 
server time for free. But that's enough for my needs (at least for now).

Usage: pdfmerge [-h] [-c secret] [OUTPUT NAME] [INPUT FILE(S)]
	   
	   -h - displays help
	   -c [secret] - saves or changes the secret API key

	   .pdf extension is automatically added to output file. 
	   Input files can be located in any directory. 
	   Output file will be created next to the Python file, unless specified
	   otherwise.
